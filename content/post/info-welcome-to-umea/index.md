## Crowdy record attempts

What is a Bonanza without attempting to break the Crowdy record? A crowdy is when several turfers takes assist on a zone simultaneously. Current record is 194 turfers, which was taken at the Bonanza in V√§stervik. We currently have 223 turfers signed up for the Bonanza so the prospects looks good for both the medal crowdy-144 and to break the record. However, this requires some coordination. We have planned for two attempts, at 12:20 and 15:20, in connection to the prize ceremonies after the two heats. We ask you kindly not to take the zone between 12:01-12:20 and 15:01-15:20.

## Your safety

Like any other Turf event, we ask you to be cautious in the traffic. Follow Swedish traffic rules and be respectful to other people. Please note that you participate at your own risk. We recommend using bright coloued clothes (e.g. yellow). We also strongly recommend wearing a helmet in the cycle heat.
